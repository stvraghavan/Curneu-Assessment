# Curneu-Assessment

The source code was written in Python on the google Colab IDE. The data source was imported from my google drive. 

Preliminary analysis of the data suggested the use of techniques for data reduction and simplification for modelling. 

Subsequently, the required packages were imported into the project to help easy working. The libraries imported includes 

Pandas 

NumPy 

Sklearn 

Seaborn, matplotlib and 

Xlrd 

The process starts by bringing in the data necessary. 

Data is segregated to have a clear idea about the model to be built. 

Ease of processing is achieved by scrubbing away the unnecessary part of the data. 

Splitting of the data into training and testing is done to check the effectiveness of the model built. 

Standardization is done so that the scale doesn't affect the process. 

Model building start when everything is ready. 

Once the model is prepared / ready, testing of the modelâ€™s starts. A confusion matrix is used to check the accuracy of classification done by our model.
